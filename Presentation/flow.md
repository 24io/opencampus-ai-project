General idea: Use (almost) no text and only images as people will listen more to what we say.

[PART 1 - TONI]

# Slide 0 [0:15] -> [total 0:15]
cover slide with names and cover image

# Slide 1 [1:00] -> [total 1:15]
Formula for matrix equation -> Ax=b
mention of iterative solvers (Generalized minimal residual method, GMRES)
[Use image of a strongly elongated ellipse to illustrate]

# Slide 2 [0:45] -> [total 2:00]
Presenting the first Problem: If matrix is ill-formed, very slow convergence
introduction of preconditioning -> PAx=Pb
[use image for transforming a ellipse to a circle to always have fast convergence]

# Slide 3 [0:30] -> [total 2:30]
Shortly introduce Block-Jacobi preconditioner
Mention that this is a parallel process so quite fast

# Slide 4 [0:45] -> [total 3:15]
Present Götz & Anzt paper
 - use Synthetic matrices
 - Train CNN
 - See if CNN's blocks provide enough speedup
[as target provide figure.8 from Götz & Anzt]

# Slide 5 [2:45] -> [total 6:00]
Present some code for the matrix generation
Talk about some of the features of the matrices
[Show matrix images]
Talk about some of the features we see
Briefly mention the Band-generation (even if we have not yet implemented it in our model)
[Crowd-Interaction: Ask audience if they are able to see the blocks in the noisy data]
Transition to CNN part


[PART 2 - ANNI]

(?) present the model architecture
# Slide 7
(?) show some training data
# Slide 8
(?) show first results - even if they're bad
# Slide 9
(?) show fine-tuning attempts
# Slide 10
(?) 
# Slide 11
(?) 
# Slide 12
