# Literature Review

Approaches or solutions that have been tried before on similar projects.

**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [Title of Source 1]

  - **[Link](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/proceedings/workshops/workshop_files/ws_lasalss102s2-file1.pdf)**
  - **Objective**:  
  The authors trained a CNN to detect coupled variables in a sparse matrix.
  The main goal was to reduce the time to improve convergence (and thus speed) of a generalized minimal residual
  method GMRES solver
  
  - **Methods**:
  A CNN with several convolutions and a single dense layer followed by a dropout (0.1) were used.
  The model was trained on synthetic data since for matrices these are easy to produce. 
  - **Outcomes**:
  The model is able to recognize coupled variables (blocks) in the input matrices.
  - **Relation to the Project**:
  The model can be used as a starting point to get a proper grip of the topic and its implementation.
